This is a Powershell Module that I created that uses GAM and Powershell to get an Active Directory Group and a Google Group.
It then Enumerated the users and does a compare and generated a list of the diffrences which then are added to the Google Group.

This Module is dependent on having GAM Installed and configured for your enviroment. You can find more information on GAM at the GitHub.
